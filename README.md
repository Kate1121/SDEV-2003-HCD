# SDEV-2003-HCD
In the HCD-1-E1-Bare Bones Template folder, I created a template for building a webiste. This template includes a folder for CSS files, a folder for JavaScript files, and an index.html file that includes metadata; header, nav, main, and footer semantic tags in the body; a link tag for a CSS file; and a script tag for a JavaScript file.

I created a form in the my-restaurant.html file so that users can enter and submit the necessary information to book a table at My Restaurant.
