# SDEV-2003-HCD
In the HCD-1-E1-Bare Bones Template folder, I created a template for building a webiste. This template includes a folder for CSS files, a folder for JavaScript files, and an index.html file that includes metadata; header, nav, main, and footer semantic tags in the body; a link tag for a CSS file; and a script tag for a JavaScript file.

I created a form in the my-restaurant.html file so that users can enter and submit the necessary information to book a table at My Restaurant.

In the HCD-2-E1-Layout folder, I incorporated the CSS flexbox layout into the header and footer sections and the CSS grid layout into the main content and sidebar sections of a webpage.

In the HCD-2-E2-Transform folder, I applied CSS effects to list items and altered the appearance of list items in a webpage.
